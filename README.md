# SchedSim
An extensible, real-time scheduler simulator for HEAPLab (PoliMi) developed in Python, SchedSim, currently in use and maintained. Real-time schedulers are the core of real-time systems, which are those systems whose requirements include the temporal domain, such as aerospace and automotive control systems.
